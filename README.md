# Description
This project was created to meet requirements for Project 1 in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program (June 2014).

Intended to test our ability to create a functional Rails app. I am currently using four models and one API source (yummly.com).

This project was conceptualized, scoped and developed in one week.

# Installation
This app requires a developer key from [Yummly](https://developer.yummly.com/).

To begin:
* Run ```bundle```
* Run ```rake db:setup```

If you would like to begin with initial seed data, run ```rake db:seed```

Thank you!
